# Module Assessment - Part 1: JavaScript

## Introduction

This assessment verifies the competencies that you learned during the module. It's a hands-on assessment that you'll complete inside your IDE.

This part of the hands-on assessment gives you a JavaScript coding challenge similar to what you may see as part of a technical interview process. You'll complete the JavaScript functions in the `assessment.js` file. Comments preceding each function in the file describe the behavior required.

**After completing this part, you need to `add`, `commit`, and `push` the code to your repository. When you've completed both parts of the coding assessment, submit your assessment in BootcampOS.**

## Hints and suggestions

* If you become stuck on one function, make some notes in comments, commenting out any code that prevents the application from running, then move on to the next function or part two of the assessment. You can revisit this work later, if you have time.
* `push` your code often. Whenever you reach a point where you feel like you've made good progress and your code builds, commit and push your changes.
* The code you submit must build properly to get scored. _Please make sure you don't have any build errors._

## Running the tests

You can check your work by viewing `test.html` in your preferred browser or using Live Server in VS Code.

## Submit your work

When you've completed this part of the assessment, be sure to push your code to your repository. When you've completed both parts of the coding assessment, submit the assessment in BootcampOS.
